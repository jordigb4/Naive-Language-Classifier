This is a project to develop a language identifier for the following European languages: English, Spanish, Dutch, German, Italian, and French. In this regard, the 'wortschatz leipzig corpora' has been utilized, consisting of 30k and 10k sentences for each language, for the training set and the test set, respectively.  
Its primary goal is academic, particulary introduce NLP concepts and tools while analyzing which text processing techniques are most effective for distinguishing languages.
